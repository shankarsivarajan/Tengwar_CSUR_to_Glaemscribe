# Tengwar – CSUR to Glaemscribe
Convert Tengwar encoded with CSUR to Glǽmscribe's format.

The Annatar Italic font (the one that looks like the One Ring script) has not yet been re-encoded into CSUR, the modern Unicode encoding for the Tengwar. [Glǽmscribe](https://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/glaemscribe.html) uses an encoding that's quite similar, mainly differing in how it handles diacritics.

This program converts a file with Tengwar encoded with CSUR into a format that Glaemscribe can then transcribe.

This program will become obsolete as soon a font re-encoding the Annatar Italic glyphs is created. Hopefully soon.
