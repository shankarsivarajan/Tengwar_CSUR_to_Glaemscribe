# Use the font [Tengwar Artano](https://github.com/shankarsivarajan/TengwarArtano) instead.


# ~~Tengwar – CSUR to Glǽmscribe~~


Convert Tengwar encoded with CSUR to Glǽmscribe's format.

~~This program will become obsolete as soon a font re-encoding the Annatar Italic glyphs is created. Hopefully soon.~~ 

This program is now obsolete.


The Annatar Italic font (the one that looks like the One Ring inscription) ***[has](https://github.com/shankarsivarajan/TengwarArtano)*** ~~not yet~~ been re-encoded into [CSUR](https://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/mapping.html), the modern Unicode encoding for the Tengwar. [Glǽmscribe](https://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/glaemscribe.html) uses an encoding that's quite similar, mainly differing in how it handles diacritics.

This program converts a file with Tengwar encoded with CSUR into a format that Glǽmscribe can then transcribe.
